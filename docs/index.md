2. **Maven Project Build**  
   - Inject environment-specific configurations.

3. **Run Static Analysis**  
   - Scan the WAR using **Application Modernization Accelerator** (AMA) / **Transformation Advisor** (TA).

4. **Upload Scan Artifacts**  
   - Push results to AMA UI and watsonx Code Assistant.

5. **Modernize WebSphere Runtime**  
   - Refactor the application from **Traditional WAS** to **Liberty**.

6. **Upgrade Java Version**  
   - Migrate to a modern, supported Java runtime.

7. **Containerize the Application**
